#Task Management Application

##Overview:

This application is a simple yet effective task management tool that allows you to add, complete, and remove tasks. Originally started as a project during a web development internship in 2021, it has since been expanded and improved to include additional features.

####ðŸ‘¶:
Although this project was small and looks simple(whitch is really are XD),but it was very challenging for me at that time. 
 it has deep meanings for me
Like the feeling of stress and discomfort that was imposed on me because of the incompleteness of this simple project
Time really flies :)

###Key Features:

- Task Creation: Enter a task in the input field and press Enter to add it to the list.
- Task Completion: Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will be visually indicated.
- Task Removal: Click on the trash icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
- Pending Tasks: The application displays the number of pending tasks and the percentage of tasks completed.

###Improvements:

- Task Completion Percentage: The application now calculates and displays the percentage of completed tasks based on the total number of tasks.
- Pending Tasks Count: The number of pending tasks is updated dynamically as tasks are added, completed, or removed.
- Visual Indicators: Completed tasks are visually highlighted to differentiate them from pending tasks.
